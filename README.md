# 🌟 AHC-PRNG (Affine-Hash Chaotic PRNG)

**Assignment for Random Number Generator (PRNG) – Designed by Munia Afrin Bethi**

---

## 🧩 Summary  
This project implements a new pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) called **AHC-PRNG**.  
It combines a lightweight XOR-shift core with **SHA-256 hashing** to improve diffusion and randomness.

> ⚠️ Note: This is an academic / assignment-level PRNG, not meant for cryptographic use.
