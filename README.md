Project Name: AHC-PRNG (Affine-Hash Chaotic Pseudorandom Number Generator)
Designed by: Munia Afrin
Purpose: To design and implement a new PRNG algorithm combining XOR-shift logic with SHA-256 hashing for enhanced randomness and diffusion.
Language Used: Python
Key Features:

256-bit internal state with SplitMix64 seeding

Generates random integers, floats, and bytes

Hash-based nonlinear mixing improves uniformity
